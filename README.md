<a name="faq"></a>

## **❓FAQ**
#### **1. How many instances of the program I can run simultaneously for same account ?**
**I will recommend to host/run 3 or less than 3 (< 3) instances for each account because Cloudflare's API have request limits. Hosting/Running too many instances can cause "Too many Requests" error which indicates that API is getting too many requestes from the same account and that's why there is a cooldown timer of 20 seconds to prevent this.**
#### **2. How to resolve "Too many request" Error ?**
**As already discussed above, Hosting/Running too many instances for same account cause this. So just switch off some instances and bring down the number to 3 or < 3 instances for the same account. Please refer to [Issue #3](https://github.com/TheCaduceus/WARP-UNLIMITED-ADVANCED/issues/3) for more details on this.**
#### **3. Will this program cause any kind of ban from Cloudflare?**
**No, this program don't cause ban because it just use the API provided by Cloudflare for referral system. Neither this program create any type of load or bypass any limit set by Cloudflare for their API nor it hacks anything or changes any official record illegally.**
#### **4. Program isn't working & producing error as shown in the image in Termux. How to solve ?**
![](./Img/Termux-Error-1.jpeg)  
**You can run the below given command in Termux to fix it easily:** 
``` 
termux-setup-storage && pkg update && pkg i git python wget -y && pkg upgrade && pip install --upgrade pip
```
#### **5. Does deploying this on Heroku/Railway/Okteto cause any ban?**
**No, this program comes in category of Cron-Job because this program just take the WARP CLIENT ID from user and arrange it in a particular format and start pinging it in an interval of 20 seconds. This program is lightweight and don't have any load on system. You can refer to [Issue #5](https://github.com/TheCaduceus/WARP-UNLIMITED-ADVANCED/issues/5) for more details on this.**
#### **6. I deployed it on a platform that allow setting Environment Variables, but program not accepting it?**
**Before deploying it on any platform which allow users to set variables in system environment, just make sure you enable `ENV` mode & disable `INTERACTIVE_MODE`.**
#### **7. Why use this program? we can simply use any mod of WARP app?**
**WARP+ is for lifting the speed cap imposed by Cloudflare on free users which is server-side limit and it can't be bypassed by just modifying client-side code. So, availabe mods of WARP is fake? yes, they are just showing premium branding while doing nothing in reality.**
